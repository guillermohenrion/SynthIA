# SynthIA
SinthIA is an advanced dialogue system designed to generate consensus-based responses by leveraging multiple AI models, including GPT-4 and Llama. The system queries both models, analyzes their responses, and synthesizes a final consensus by combining the strengths of each. SinthIA is highly customizable, allowing users to define the number of iterations for refining the dialogue. Itâ€™s ideal for tasks requiring balanced perspectives, such as decision-making support or conflict resolution.
